# Project Overview

In this project I wrote a number of tests using Jasmine againts a pre-existing web-based application that reads RSS feeds.
 
## Instruction

Open index.html file in a browser. Test results including number of specs and failures should be displayed at the bottom of the page.
There are 7 specs in this test.

The first test ensures that name and URL of each feed are defined and not empty.
The second test ensures that the menu is hidden by default and changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.
The third test ensures that there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.
The fourth test ensures the feed content actually changes after a new feed has been loaded.
